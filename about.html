            <div class="aboutDescription">For Muddy Paws founder Chris Columbus, exploring the outdoors has been his way of life since the beginning, be it by land, air, or sea. He’s also always tried to find a way to include his pets in his adventures, both his dog Rafael and even his cat Roger. When he realized that there wasn’t a market for pet adventure gear, he sought to design his own, giving his pets the chance to experience the adventure of a lifetime. 
            Today, the pet adventure gear company born out of Chris’s basement has launched worldwide, bringing pets and their owners closer together as they adventure across the world. 
            So... what are you waiting for? Let the next adventure begin.
